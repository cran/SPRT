Title: Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) Method
Authors@R: person("Huchesh", "Budihal", email = "hhbudihal17@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides functions to perform the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) 
  for hypothesis testing in Binomial, Poisson and Normal distributions. 
  The package allows users to specify Type I and Type II error probabilities, 
  decision thresholds, and compare null and alternative hypotheses sequentially 
  as data accumulate. It includes visualization tools for plotting the likelihood 
  ratio path and decision boundaries, making it easier to interpret results. 
  The methods are based on Wald (1945) <doi:10.1214/aoms/1177731118>, 
  who introduced the SPRT as one of the earliest and most powerful sequential 
  analysis techniques. This package is useful in quality control, clinical trials, 
  and other applications requiring early decision-making.The term 'SPRT' is an abbreviation and used intentionally.
